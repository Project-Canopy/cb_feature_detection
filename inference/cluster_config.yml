# to install Cortex in an existing VPC, you can provide a list of subnets for your cluster to use
# subnet_visibility (specified above in this file) must match your subnets' visibility
# this is an advanced feature (not recommended for first-time users) and requires your VPC to be configured correctly; see https://eksctl.io/usage/vpc-networking/#use-existing-vpc-other-custom-configuration
# here is an example:
# subnets:
#   - availability_zone: us-west-2a
#     subnet_id: subnet-060f3961c876872ae

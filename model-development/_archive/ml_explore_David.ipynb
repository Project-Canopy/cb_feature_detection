      " |  Wraps a SavedModel (or a legacy Hub.Module) as a Keras Layer.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  This layer wraps a callable object for use as a Keras layer. The callable\n",
      " |  object can be passed directly, or be specified by a Python string with a\n",
      " |  handle that gets passed to `hub.load()`.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  This is the preferred API to load a TF2-style SavedModel from TF Hub\n",
      " |  into a Keras model. Calling this function requires TF 1.15 or newer.\n",
      " |  It can be called both in eager and graph mode.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  The callable object is expected to follow the conventions detailed below.\n",
      " |  (These are met by TF2-compatible modules loaded from TensorFlow Hub.)\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  The callable is invoked with a single positional argument set to one tensor\n",
      " |  or a nest of tensors containing the inputs to the layer. If the callable\n",
      " |  accepts a `training` argument, a Python boolean is passed for it. It is True\n",
      " |  if this layer is marked trainable *and* called for training.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  If present, the following attributes of callable are understood to have\n",
      " |  special meanings:\n",
      " |    variables: a list of all tf.Variable objects that the callable depends on.\n",
      " |    trainable_variables: those elements of `variables` that are reported\n",
      " |      as trainable variables of this Keras Layer when the layer is trainable.\n",
      " |    regularization_losses: a list of callables to be added as losses of this\n",
      " |      Keras Layer when the layer is trainable. Each one must accept zero\n",
      " |      arguments and return a scalar tensor.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  Note: to work-around missing shape inference functionalities from functions\n",
      " |  created from FunctionDefs, in rare cases one has to pass an 'output_shape'\n",
      " |  and potentially 'input_shape' and 'dtype'. E.g. the following is a typical\n",
      " |  work-around:\n",
      " |  ```\n",
      " |  hub.KerasLayer(\n",
      " |      \"/tmp/text_embedding_model\",\n",

      " |  explicitly from Keras objects instead of relying on graph collections.\n",
      " |  This layer class does not support graph collections.\n",
